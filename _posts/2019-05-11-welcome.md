### There are a few things that you should know up-front:
If you wish to use VirtualBox on Windows, you must ensure that **Hyper-V** is not enabled on Windows. You can turn off the feature by running this Powershell command:

```Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All```

You can also disable it by going through the Windows system settings:

Right click on the Windows button and select ‘Apps and Features’.
Select Turn Windows Features on or off.
Unselect **Hyper-V** and click **OK**.
You might have to reboot your machine for the changes to take effect. More information about Hyper-V can be read here.
